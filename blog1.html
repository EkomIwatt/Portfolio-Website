                Welcome to my corner of the internet 😇
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                As a third-year Computer Engineering student at Unilag, I spend a lot of time thinking about code, circuits, and systems. But recently, I’ve been thinking about something else: <strong>identity</strong>. How do I represent who I am and what I can do?
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                I set a goal for myself to build a CV I’m proud of by the end of 2026. But a CV felt like only a polite handshake. I needed something dynamic; a living, breathing place that could grow alongside my skills.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-mutedBlue pl-4 italic my-8 bg-warmLight/30 py-4 pr-4 rounded-r">
                "So, on the 2nd of January, I set a strict personal deadline: <strong>January 15, 2026</strong>. I had to design, build, and deploy a portfolio website."
            </blockquote>

            <p class="mb-12">Here is the story of how it came together.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-deepBlue">1. The Conception: "Techy, but Warm"</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">
                I didn't want a website that looked like a generic template. I wanted it to feel approachable yet professional—a site that says “hire me” without sounding like a corporate robot.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                I settled on a specific design philosophy: <strong>Simple, tech-oriented, yet warm.</strong> Instead of the standard stark black and white, I visited <a href="https://colorhunt.co/" class="text-mutedBlue underline hover:text-deepBlue">Color Hunt</a> and found a palette that I really liked for its calmness:
            </p>

            <div class="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-5 gap-2 my-8 font-mono text-xs text-center font-bold">
                <div class="p-4 rounded shadow-sm text-white" style="background-color: #213448;">#213448<br>Deep Blue</div>
                <div class="p-4 rounded shadow-sm text-white" style="background-color: #547792;">#547792<br>Muted Blue</div>
                <div class="p-4 rounded shadow-sm text-deepBlue" style="background-color: #94B4C1;">#94B4C1<br>Accent Blue</div>
                <div class="p-4 rounded shadow-sm text-deepBlue" style="background-color: #EAE0CF;">#EAE0CF<br>Warm Light</div>
                <div class="p-4 rounded shadow-sm text-deepBlue border border-gray-200" style="background-color: #F9F7F2;">#F9F7F2<br>Paper White</div>
            </div>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Then I began building and implementing ideas because I wasn't even certain what exactly I wanted to do.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-deepBlue">2. The Stack</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                I wanted the user experience to be clean, so I decided to stick to the fundamentals to ensure I had full control over the performance and layout.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 ml-4">
                <li><strong>HTML5 & CSS3:</strong> For the structure and styling.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> To bring the interactivity to life.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Then I actually stumbled upon <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> for the first time. I know I've seen it in code a couple of times, but I never realised it was literally CSS in HTML. Anyway, I fell in love with it in a day. It really sped up my styling process and helped maintain consistency and responsiveness.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-deepBlue">3. The Challenges (It wasn't all smooth sailing)</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">No project is complete without a few headaches. Two specific challenges stood out during the build:</p>
            
            <div class="space-y-6">
                <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-red-400">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">The Mobile Background</h3>
                    <p>I spent a significant amount of time wrestling with the hero section. On a desktop, the background image looked great. On mobile? Not so much. It clashed with the text and made things unreadable. I eventually had to pivot, stripping the background image on smaller screens and using a placeholder for the image—kinda like a profile picture. It was a lesson in "function over form."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 border-yellow-400">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">The Contact Form</h3>
                    <p>I wanted people to be able to reach me directly without opening their email client. Integrating <strong>EmailJS</strong> seemed straightforward at first, but that wasn't the case when I got into it. I had to style, then debug the form receiving logic. Honestly, it took more coffee than I’d like to admit. Getting that first successful test email was a massive relief.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-deepBlue">4. What’s Next?</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">This website is just the container; now I need to fill it.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Overall, I learnt a lot in the process. From GitHub to Tailwind to EmailJS, I now have a ton of new knowledge and discovered tools. Previously, all I did was learn and learn—my siblings say I study too much. But with this journey, I fully realised that I need to stop 'learning' and start 'doing'.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Over the coming months (and years), I’ll be documenting my journey here; from my experiments with <strong>Arduino and embedded systems</strong> to my deep dives into <strong>C++ and Rust</strong>. And beyond code and tech, I'll write about just about anything that comes to mind on my Blog, so stay tuned!
            </p>
            <p class="mb-12 font-medium">
                If you’re reading this, thanks for stopping by. The site is live, the code is shipped, and I'll keep making adjustments and additions. I’m ready for the next bug!
